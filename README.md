# ReCorDS
Developement of Reverse-Correlation Data Structure (ReCorDS).

ReCorDS is a novel way to organize data. Inspired from [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/), it has been specifically adapted for Bubbles and Reverse-Correlation data. Both BIDS and ReCorDS have the goal to create a intuitive universal folder and file structure that quickens data analysis.
Incidentatly, ReCorDs was created to simplify, unify, and accelerate data analysis in the visual cognitive neuroscience field.


We start with MATLAB code and study from [Faghel-Soubeyrand et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000542) where the authors used the bubbles reverse-correlation technique on 140 participants.
