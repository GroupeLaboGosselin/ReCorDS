# The Bubbles Face Induction Study
## Description

Face recognition ability varies tremendously among neurologically typical individuals. What causes these
differences is still largely unknown. Here, we first used a data-driven experimental technique—
bubbles—to measure the use of local facial information in 140 neurotypical individuals during a face-sex
categorization task. We discovered that the use of the eye and eyebrow area located on the right side of
the face image from the observer’s viewpoint correlates positively with performance, whereas the use of
the left-eye and eyebrow area correlates negatively with performance. We then tested if performance
could be altered by inducing participants to use either the right- or the left-eye area. One hundred of these
participants thus underwent a 1-hr session of a novel implicit training procedure aimed at inducing the
use of specific facial information. Afterward, participants repeated the bubbles face-sex categorization
task to assess the changes in use of information and its effect on performance. Participants that underwent
right-eye induction used this facial region more than they initially did and, as expected, improved their
performance more than the participants who underwent the left-eye induction. This is the first clear
evidence of a causal link between the use of specific face information and face recognition ability: Use
of right-eye region not only predicts but causes better face-sex categorization.
