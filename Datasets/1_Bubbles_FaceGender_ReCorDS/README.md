# The Bubbles face induction study

[Faghel-Soubeyrand et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000542) where the authors used the bubbles reverse-correlation technique on 140 participants to study how face information causes better face-recognition ability.

# Description
## Method
*Spatial Bubbles* on N = 140 neurotypicals (300 trials each)
*Spatial Bubbles* + *implicit visual strategy induction procedure* (500 trials each) on N=100 of these 140 individuals. Post-induction phase : 300 trials of the spatial Bubbles. procedure to look at any change in visual representations.
